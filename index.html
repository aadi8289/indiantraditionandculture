<H1>The culture in India</H1>

<B>Let’s explore some of the key elements of Indian culture:<B/>

<H1>Greetings</H1>

<img src=greeting.jpg width=700><br>

Greetings are a huge part of the culture in every culture. In India, the greeting ‘Namaste’, which is often called namaskar or namaskaram, is arguably the most widely used across the country. Namaste translates to ‘I bow to the divine in you’ and so is a way of greeting people with great respect. This greeting can be used in a variety of ways. It can be used to say hello, goodbye, or even, thank you. Namaste is not just a verbal greeting, but a physical one as well. To accompany the word ‘Namaste’, people place their hands together in a prayer position in front of their chest, with their fingers pointing up, and perform a slight bow.

Namaste is not the only popular Indian greeting. Another common greeting that you will hear across the country is ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’. This is a piece of Sanskrit, which is an ancient Indo-European language of India, taken from Hindu scripture. Atithi Devo Bhava translates to ‘the guest is equivalent to god’. This is a way of greeting guests with a great deal of respect.

Another physical greeting that you may come across in India is a head shake, which can mean yes, thank you, or an indication or acknowledgement of understanding.

<H1>Family </H1>

In India, the concept of a joint family is where all family members live in one residence. The family dynamic in India places a ‘Karta’ at the head of the family. A Karta is an appointed senior male or female member of the family who makes economic and social decisions on behalf of the entire family unit. In a joint family, all of the money and income are transferred into a communal pool. This means that all members of the family benefit from the money coming in. Whilst this type of family dynamic is still likely more prevalent in India than it is in other parts of the world, like the United Kingdom, it is in decline.

Another major Indian tradition related to family life is arranged marriage. This is a tradition that dates all the way back to around 1500–1100 BCE and involves parents choosing suitable partners for their children.

<H1>Food</H1>

India is known for its delicious food and, as such, the country’s cuisine is enjoyed all over the globe. Each individual region in India has its own distinct cuisine, with a signature dish or ingredient directly linked with that area. For instance, regions like Gujarat and Rajasthan are particularly good for vegetarian food, whilst other regions like Bengali and Mughal are better known for more meat-heavy dishes.

Indian food is brimming with scrumptious, fresh ingredients and a vast range of herbs and spices, all working together to create colourful, aromatic, mouth-watering dishes.

In terms of how they eat, cutlery is not a massive part of Indian cuisine. It is a tradition in India to eat food with your hands, eating slowly so as to fully enjoy your meal.

<H1>Religion</H1>

<img src=riligion.jpg><br>

India is a melting pot of religions, with the majority of the population identifying with Hinduism (79.8%), and the rest of the country being split between Islam (14.2%), Christianity (2.3%), Sikhism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%), and Jainism (0.4%).

One of the major differences between Indian culture and the culture in the United Kingdom is how we view animals. In India, the cow is viewed as a sacred animal that is portrayed throughout mythology as accompanying several gods, including Shiva and Krishna. In Indian tradition, a cow’s horns are representative of the gods, and their four legs are ‘Vedas’, which are religious texts originating in Ancient India. Moreover, the udders of a cow are believed to represent the four objectives of life, which are desire, material wealth, righteousness, and salvation. Whilst it may be standard practice in many parts of the world, eating or killing a cow is considered a great sin in India. It is actually illegal to kill a cow in many states across India.

Another major part of religion in India is fasting. Fasts, which are also known as ‘Vrats’ or ‘Upvas’ are used as a way to show gratitude to the gods and goddesses in India. It is believed that the act of depriving oneself of food is a way of cleansing the body of sin.



<H1>Temples</H1>

When travelling across India, you will come across a host of beautiful, intricate, and breathtaking temples. These structures are of great religious significance and draw countless tourists every year.

Oftentimes, temples are built in locations where there is a significant amount of positive energy from the magnetic wave lines of the Earth. What’s more, temples are typically centred around one main idol, which will be mounted on a copper plate called the Garbhagriha or Moolasthan.

Temples are not just beautiful, but sacred buildings, and so respect is of the utmost importance when visiting them. As they are so sacred, it is traditional in India for people to bathe or have a shower before entering a temple. At the very least, people will wash their hands and feet thoroughly before entering a temple as a sign of respect and to cleanse themselves of any negative thoughts and evil influences.

Clothing is also used as a sign of respect for visiting temples in India. For women, the typical dress is very modest, with clothing covering the majority of their bodies. Men, similarly, are very covered and typically wear trousers and a shirt. It is also required for people to remove their footwear before entering a temple. This stops any dirt from the outside from getting into the sacred, cleansed environment in the temple.

<H1>Indian traditions</H1>

<B>There is a wide range of fascinating Indian traditions worth exploring. Here are just a few of the major traditions in India:</B>

<H1>Kumbh Mela</H1>

<img src=kumbh.jpg><br>

The Kumbh Mela is the largest gathering of religious pilgrims in the world. The location of this festival rotates around four pilgrimage destinations across a 12-year cycle. The destinations are as follows: Haridwar, Allahabad, Nashik, and Ujjai. The biggest attendees of Kumbh Mela are the Naga Sadhus, who are followers of Lord Shiva. The Naga Sadhus reside in the Himalayas, and Kumbh Mela is the only time of year that they come down to the plains. It is also the only time of year that someone can become a Naga Sadhu.

The purpose of the Kumbh Mela is to cleanse people of their sins by bathing in sacred waters.

<H1>Lathmar Holi of Uttar Pradesh</H1>

In English, Lathmar Holi of Uttar Pradesh translates to ‘hitting with sticks’. This is an Indian festival that is celebrated before the festival of Holi in the towns of Nandgaon and Barsana. The reason Lathmar Holi of Uttar Pradesh is only celebrated in these towns is due to an Indian legend. The legend states that the Lord Krishna of Nandgaon visited his love, Radha, in the town of Barsana on the day that the festival is celebrated. The story goes that women chased Lord Krishna away using long staves called lathis. In response to this playful gesture, the men of Barsana invaded the town of Nandgaon.

<H1>Thimithi</H1>

Thimithi, which is also known as the fire-walking tradition of Tamil Nadu, is celebrated in a number of different countries, including Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Malaysia. The festival originated in Tamil Nadu, which is a state in Southern India and takes place during the months of October and November every year. The purpose of Thimithi is to honour the Draupati Amman, who was the wife of the five Pandava brothers in the Mahabharata. At the festival, men will honour Draupati by walking across a sheet of burning coal while carrying a pot of milk or water on their heads for balance. This act is believed to show how devoted they are to their faith.

<H1>Yoga</H1>

Whilst it is practised all across the world as a form of exercise, yoga is an Ancient Indian tradition. Yoga is a physical practice that is believed to unify the body, mind, and soul to improve a person’s overall mental, spiritual and physical wellbeing. The practice of yoga involves a range of movements and poses, all of which are designed to discipline your mind, body, and breath. Some of the elements of a typical yoga practice include meditation, controlled breathing, word chanting, and sequences of complex poses. There are a multitude of benefits to practising yoga regularly, which is why it is so popular across the world.
